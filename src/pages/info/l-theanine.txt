L-Theanine is a unique amino acid found naturally in tea leaves, especially green tea. Known for its calming effects, L-theanine promotes relaxation without causing drowsiness, making it ideal for reducing stress and anxiety. It can also enhance focus and mental clarity, and when combined with other sleep-supportive ingredients, L-theanine may help improve sleep quality by encouraging a calm, relaxed state before bedtime

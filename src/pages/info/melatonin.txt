Melatonin is a natural hormone produced by the pineal gland in the brain, primarily responsible for regulating the body’s sleep-wake cycle. Often referred to as the “sleep hormone,” melatonin levels rise in the evening to signal that it’s time to sleep and decrease in the morning to help you wake up. Supplementing with melatonin can help people who have trouble falling asleep, experience jet lag, or work irregular hours, making it a popular and gentle aid for improving sleep quality and supporting a healthy circadian rhythm
